Installation
============

Install the extension.

To enable the extension you have to set **plugin.tx_powermailpdf.settings.enablePowermailPdf = 1**. You can add this to the TS of a page where the powermail formula is located.
This is important if you have more powermail forms but just one needs
the pdf filling feature.
