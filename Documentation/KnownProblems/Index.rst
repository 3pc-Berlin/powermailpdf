Known Problems
==============

1. Can only fill checkboxes in pdf file when pdftk is installed

2. If your template PDF is not compatible with this script, you can process it with pdftk this way:

- pdftk modele.pdf output modele2.pdf

Then try again with modele2.pdf.

The pdf links generated in mail may not work properly. This feature is still buggy.
